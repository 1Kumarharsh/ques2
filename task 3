Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.


solution:-
 def longestConsecutive(nums):
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest_seq = 0
    for num in num_set:
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            curr_seq = 1
            while num + 1 in num_set:
                curr_seq += 1
                num += 1
            longest_seq = max(longest_seq, curr_seq)
    return longest_seq
    
    a = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 6]
    print(longestConsecutive(a))
    
    a =[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
    print(longestConsecutive(a))
